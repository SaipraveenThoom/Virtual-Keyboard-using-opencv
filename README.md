# Virtual-Keyboard-using-opencv
This is a project designed to operate the keyboard with the help of gestures and detection of hand over the computer screen.

Requirements to Run this Project:
An Integrated Camera

Working:
When the code is run after all the requirements were satisfied, It turns on the camera and starts capturing the video of an Individual. When we place our hands before the camera, it detects landmarks on the hand with the help of Hand_Detection module which is to be installed.
5 different layouts were designed and can be accessed using different gestures.

First layout defined works in such a way that we need to open any text editor like a notepad and in this first layout, the key that gets typed is the one which is pointed by your index finger and palacing your middle finger intact with index finger.

We can access second layout by taking thumb and index finger close together. The keys defined in this layout can also be typed in the same way as that in layout 1. The key with index finger targeted on it will be typed.

Third layout can be accessed by taking middle finger and thumb finger together.  The keys defined in this layout can also be typed in the same way as that in layout 1. The key with index finger targeted on it will be typed while holding thumb and middle finger together.

Fourth layout can be accessed by taking ring finger and thumb finger together.  The keys defined in this layout can also be typed in the same way as that in layout 1. The key with index finger targeted on it will be typed while holding thumb and ring finger together.

Fifth layout can be accessed by taking little finger and thumb finger together.  The keys defined in this layout can also be typed in the same way as that in layout 1. The key with index finger targeted on it will be typed while holding thumb and little finger together.

The keys will act accordingly as defined.


Step 1:
Install all the requirements
I have used Python 3.8 for working

Step 2:
Run the Code. Open a text editor to use the keyboard designed On-Screen.
